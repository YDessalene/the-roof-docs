                    <p>Are you looking to sell your house? If so, it's crucial that you make sure your home is in excellent condition â€” especially your roof. Many homeowners overlook their roofing needs during the stress of putting their home on the market, but undetected damage can turn into an obstacle in the way of closing a deal.</p>
                    <p>Roof-ER offers <a href="/the-roof-docs/#/inspection">free inspections</a> for roofs, siding and gutters before any repair or replacement service. We'll fully assess your roof's condition before performing repair or replacement services. Plus, we repair and replace most types of roofs quickly, so you can focus on optimizing your home's value.</p>
                    <p>Roof replacements <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i5695.pdf">can be tax deductible</a> if they&nbsp;make your home more sustainable, as outlined by the IRS's energy-efficient home improvement guidelines. You could qualify for a federal tax deduction of up to 10% if your roof replacement meets the following criteria:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It's for your main residence.</li>
                        <li>It's not for a new home or rental property.</li>
                        <li>It's a reflective roof.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In any case, you'll want to consult a tax expert to fully understand your eligibility for this tax deduction.</p>
                    <h2>Siding Replacement</h2>
