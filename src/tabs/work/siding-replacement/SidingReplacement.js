                    <h2>Common&nbsp;Aluminum&nbsp;Siding Problems</h2>
                    <p>Aluminum&nbsp;siding may need replacement for a variety of reasons. Some of the most common problems we address with our siding replacement services in Fairfax County include the following:</p>
                    <h3>Dents From Hail Damage&nbsp;</h3>
                    <p>Aluminum siding is more susceptible to weather issues, so we frequently see hail damage to aluminum siding. Large hail can make permanent punctures and dents in aluminum siding because of the material's composition, and strong storms are known to leave oxidation marks on aluminum siding. When this happens, it's a smart idea to have your aluminum siding replaced vs repaired.</p>
                    <h3>Water Damage</h3>
                    <p>Especially in rainy climates,&nbsp;aluminum&nbsp;siding is prone to water damage.&nbsp;Water leaks can damage walls and cause the aluminum siding to rust.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>Interior Wall Damage</h3>
                    <p>If your interior walls are damaged, it's a sure sign that water is leaking in from the outside — most likely due to siding problems.&nbsp;Aluminum siding has often been used to cover up structural damage in older homes.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>Increasing Energy Bills</h3>
                    <p>There are many reasons for increased energy bills. However, if your energy consumption spikes for no discernible reason, the culprit may be damaged aluminum siding disrupting your home's temperature control.</p>
