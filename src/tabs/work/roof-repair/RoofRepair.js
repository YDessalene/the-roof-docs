                    <h2>Common Roof Problems</h2>
                    <p>Here are some of the most common roof problems that our&nbsp;<a href="/the-roof-docs/#/mission">roof repair company</a>&nbsp;in Tysons can address:</p>
                    <h3>Roof Leaks</h3>
                    <p>Roof leaks are common issues in Northern VA. They typically occur after periods of heavy rain, and they indicate that your roof has:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cracked or otherwise damaged flashing</li>
                        <li>Broken or torn shingles or tiles</li>
                        <li>Damaged skylights</li>
                        <li>Chimney cracks</li>
                        <li>Improperly sealed roof penetrations</li>
                        <li>Carpenter gaps in the roof decking</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There are many causes for roof leaks, and the location of the leaks often indicates where your roof may be damaged.</p>
                    <h3>Pooled Water</h3>
                    <p>Pooled water occurs after a rainstorm and can result in water damage to your roof if it's left untreated. However, tapering your roof's slope will prevent pools of water from forming. If you've had water pooling on your roof for multiple days or weeks, you need to have your roof inspected for water damage before any tapering can be completed.</p>
                    <h3>Shrinkage</h3>
                    <p>Shrinkage happens when your roofing materials begin to deteriorate, warp or crack as a result of aging. When shrinkage occurs, you need to have the issue addressed as soon as possible.</p>
                    <h3>Hail Damage</h3>
                    <p>Even,&nbsp;<a href="/the-roof-docs/#/faqs">places like Northern VA experience hail</a>. When hailstorms occur, they tend to cause varying degrees of damage to roofs. Hail damage can be difficult to assess but, if present, can lead to costly repairs. It is best to consult a professional roof inspector if you believe your home has been <a href="/the-roof-docs/#/blog/hail-damage">impacted by hail</a>.</p>
                    <h3>Storm Damage (Wind)</h3>
                    <p>Strong storms are also common reasons for roof repair service in the Tysons area. When your roof is exposed to strong gusts of wind, your shingles blow off, leaving your roof vulnerable to more serious damage. Storms can also pummel your roof with debris, which can prove quite destructive to most roof types.</p>
