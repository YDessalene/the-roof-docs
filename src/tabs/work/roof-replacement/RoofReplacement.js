                    <h2>What Is a Full Roof Replacement?</h2>
                    <p>A full roof replacement involves the following steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Stripping all of the old layer of shingles from the roof</li>
                        <li>Installing Ice &amp; Water barrier and Drip Edges</li>
                        <li>Applying an underlayment to the roof deck</li>
                        <li>Securing starter shingles to the roof's perimeter</li>
                        <li>Ensuring all flashing as been replaced</li>
                        <li>Installing new shingles on top of the underlying components</li>
                        <li>Installing hip &amp; ridge cap shingles and remaining accessories</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Note that if the deck is damaged, it will need repairs once the existing shingles have been removed.</p>
                    <h2>What Is the Difference Between Re-Roofing and a Full Roof Replacement?</h2>
                    <p>If you need a full roof replacement in Fairfax County, it's important to understand the difference between a roof replacement and re-roofing.</p>
                    <p>Our process for a full roof replacement in Vienna and surrounding cities includes removing all of the roof's shingles and replacing them with new materials. Re-roofing involves placing new shingles over top existing shingles. In general, a roof replacement is a better construction practice than re-roofing.</p>
                    <h2>Roofing Materials Used for Full Roof Replacements in Fairfax County</h2>
                    <p>When it comes to full roof replacements, we typically use asphalt roof shingles due to their extreme popularity in this region's residential construction. Here are the main components of asphalt shingles we use in roof replacements:</p>
                    <h3>Asphalt Roof Shingles</h3>
                    <p>Asphalt roof shingles consist of the following components:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Fiberglass:&nbsp;</strong>A thin fiberglass mat is the foundation of asphalt shingles. This is what the asphalt adheres to during the manufacturing process.</li>
                        <li><strong>Asphalt:&nbsp;</strong>Asphalt is applied to the top and bottom of the fiberglass mat and is the main weather-proofing component of the shingle.</li>
                        <li><strong>Granules</strong>: Granules are what gives most shingles their look. They are color-coated and embedded into the top layer of the asphalt. Many granules also act as a natural fungicide against blue-green algae (which causes the dark streaking found on many older roofs).</li>
                        <li><strong>Sealant</strong>: Every shingle comes with a heat-activated sealant along the underside of the shingle. This is what ensures overlying shingles properly seal to the underlying shingle, allowing for a water-tight roofing system.</li>
                        <li><strong>Release Film</strong>: This is a plastic strip which is used on the bottom of the shingle to prevent shingles in the same package from becoming adhered to one another during storage. The release film remains in-tact during roofing installation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Roof Replacement Process</h2>
                    <p>The roof replacement process from start to finish at The Roof Docs involves the following steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Performing a roofing inspection to assess the damage and choose a roof replacement plan</li>
                        <li>Preparing your home environment for the roofing process with tarps and plywood as needed</li>
                        <li>Removing existing shingles</li>
                        <li>Inspecting and repairing damage to the deck if needed</li>
                        <li>Making sure the flashing is properly installed</li>
                        <li>Installing underlayment and starter strip shingles</li>
                        <li>Installing remaining roofing materials</li>
                        <li>Post-installation cleanup</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>How Long Does a Full Roof Replacement Take?</h2>
                    <p>Depending on the size of the roof and the labor required, a full roof replacement in Tysons using asphalt shingles takes only a day or two.</p>
                    <h2>When Will Insurance Cover Roof Replacements?</h2>
                    <p>If you experience hail or wind damage, your insurance company should cover the roof repair cost.</p>
                    <h2>Will Replacing Your Roof Increase Your Property Value?</h2>
                    <p>Yes! Getting new roofing is a valuable home improvement. Brand-new roofing will increase your home's property value. In fact, new roofing can yield 80% of its cost to you upon resale.</p>
